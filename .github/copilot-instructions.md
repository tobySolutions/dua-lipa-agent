This project is a Dua Lipa-themed Next.js web app demo. Use Vercel AI SDK for OpenAI integration. The app should be mobile-first, with a main page featuring a Dua Lipa image, status panel (hunger/happiness/energy), action buttons (Girl Dinner, Sing, Hug, Nap), and a chat feature. Use rounded, card-based UI and bold, modern styling.
